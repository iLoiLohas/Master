<h1>The (1+1)-Evolution Strategy</h1>

<p>
	The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is
	one of the most powerful evolutionary algorithms for real-valued
	optimization.
	The CMA-ES is a variable metric algorithm, which efficiently adapts
	its search distribution to the problem at hand. This, together with
	the fact that it can be reliably used with small population sizes,
	is the reason for the high efficiency of the CMA-ES.
</p>

<p>
	The CMA-ES possesses several important invariance properties. It
	is solely based on the ranking of candidate solutions and therefore
	invariant under order-preserving transformations of the objective
	function.  The CMA-ES is invariant under angle-preserving
	transformations of the input space, like translation, rotation and
	reflection, given that the initial solution is transformed
	accordingly. The algorithm is not affected by an overall rescaling of
	the search space, given that the initial scaling parameter is chosen
	accordingly. In the end, the CMA-ES is even invariant under any full
	rank linear transformation of the search space, given that the initial
	covariance matrix is also transformed accordingly.

<p>
	Several variants of the CMA-ES are implemented in the EALib. In this
	tutorial, we consider the elitist (1+1)-CMA-ES as an example.
	Elitism means that the best solution is never discarded from the
	population.  It is generally faster for fine-tuning on unimodal
	functions, but for noisy and/or multimodal optimization problems the
	standard variant is preferable.  For step size adaption, the
	(1+1)-CMA-ES uses an improved 1/5-th success rule, which replaces the
	cumulative path length control in the standard CMA-ES.
