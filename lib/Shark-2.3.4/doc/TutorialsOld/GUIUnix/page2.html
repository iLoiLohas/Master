<h1>Setting Up the Project Files</h1>
<p>
	In the directory <b>[SharkRoot]/examples/ReClaM/QT/</b>
	you find several project files, one for each graphical example.
</p>

<h2>Setting the Shark Directory</h2>

For example, the file <b>classification.pro</b> looks like this:
<pre><div class="code"><div class='newcode'>SHARKHOME = ../../../</div>
CONFIG  = qt console warn_on

INCLUDEPATH = . $${SHARKHOME}/include

win32{
   LIBS = -L$${SHARKHOME}/lib/winnt/release -lShark
}

!win32{
   LIBS = -L$${SHARKHOME}/lib/ -lShark
}

SOURCES = classification.cpp
HEADERS = classification.h
TARGET = classification</div></pre>

<p>
	Usually, all you have to do is to edit this file and to set 
	the SHARKHOME variable to the directory where you installed the 
	Shark library. In case that you have a non-standard installation
	of the library and the include files, you have to set the INCLUDEPATH
	and the LIBS variable accordingly.

	If you installed Shark to the <b>[SharkRoot]</b> directory (that is
	the default), you have to do nothing.

<h2>Setting the Qwt Directory</h2>
<p>
	If you want to build an example requiring Qwt, then you have to
	set the path to the directories where the Qwt library and
	developer files are installed. A sample project file looks
	like this:
</p>

<pre><div class="code">SHARKHOME = ../../../

CONFIG  = qt console warn_on

win32{
   QWTHOME = E:\qwt-5.0.2
   INCLUDEPATH += $${QWTHOME}/src/
   LIBS = -L$${SHARKHOME}/lib/winnt/release -L$${QWTHOME}/lib/ -lShark -lqwt
}

!win32{
<div class='newcode'>   QWTHOME = /usr/
   INCLUDEPATH += $${QWTHOME}/include/qwt/
   LIBS = -L$${SHARKHOME}/lib -L$${QWTHOME}/lib/ -lShark -lqwt</div>}

INCLUDEPATH += . $${SHARKHOME}/include

SOURCES = gaussian_process.cpp
HEADERS = gaussian_process.h
TARGET = gaussian_process
</div></pre>

<p>
	The lines you have to modify are highlighted.
