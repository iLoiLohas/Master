<h1>Execution</h1>

<p>
	As the vast majority of the Shark examples are console applications
	they are run in a console window. Go to &quot;Execute Program&quot;
	in your Start menu and type<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>cmd</tt><br>
	A console (or shell) windows should appear.
</p>
<p>
	First you have to change
	the directory (maybe even the drive) to the corresponding directory:
</p>

<div class="shell">&gt; cd [SharkRoot]\examples\LinAlg\WinNT\Release
</div>

<p>To run the executable just type its name:</p>

<div class="shell">&gt; g_inverse_matrix.exe
input matrix:
1       2       -1
2       5       -1
1       2       0

generalized inverse matrix:
2       -2      3
-1      1       -1
-1      -1.94289e-16   1
</div>

<p>
	The program outputs a matrix and its inverse, which is computed
	with a call to Shark's LinAlg module. As you can see the computation
	is not 100% exact, as the computation of the inverse is a numerically
	challenging task (although the inaccuracy is very close to the
	numerical limits).
</p>

<p>
	That's it! You can use the example programs (including the project files)
	as a starting point for own programs and experiments.
