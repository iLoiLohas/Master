<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a basic classification method
	from parametric statistics. It is based on a maximum a posteriori
	estimate of the class membership under the assumption that the class
	conditional densities are multi-variate Gaussians having different
	means but a common covariance matrix. Despite its simplicity, LDA
	gives surprisingly good results in practice, of course crucially
	depending on the representation of the input patterns.
</p>

<p>
	In the ReClaM framework, we view LDA as a pattern recognition method,
	where the estimation of the densities corresponds to learning or
	machine training and the maximum likelihood computation yields the
	prediction.
