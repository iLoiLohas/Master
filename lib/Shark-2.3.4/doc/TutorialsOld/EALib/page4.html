<h1>Selection</h1>
<p>
	Selection occurs two times in the evolutionary loop.  First, in order
	to generate offsprings, parents must be selected from the current
	population (mating selection).  Second, the new parent population has
	to be selected from the offspring and the previous parents.  In at
	least one of these selection processes the chance to select a
	particular individual must be related to its fitness value or its rank
	in the population, respectively.
</p>
<p>
	Various selection operators are implemented in the EALib.
	In the following, some examples are given.
</p>
<p>
	In original Genetic Algorithms (GAs),
	fitness proportional selection is
	frequently used. Here is an example, which implements 
	proportional selection combined with elitism.
	That is, it is ensured that the best individual found so far 
	remains in the population.
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/Population.h>
...
  const unsigned PopSize     = 20;
  const unsigned NumElitists = 1;

  Population parents   ( PopSize, ... );
  Population offsprings( PopSize, ... );

...

  parents.selectProportional( offsprings, NumElitists );
...
</div></pre>

<p>
	The next example implements comma-selection known from evolution
	strategies. 
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/Population.h>
...
  const unsigned Mu     = 15;
  const unsigned Lambda = 100;

  Population parents   ( Mu,     ... );
  Population offsprings( Lambda, ... );
...
  parents.selectMuLambda( offsprings );
...
</div></pre>

<p>
	Plus selection (i.e., selecting the best individuals from the union of
	parents and offspring) is done like this:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/Population.h>
...
  const unsigned Mu     = 15;
  const unsigned Lambda = 100;

  Population parents   ( Mu,     ... );
  Population offsprings( Lambda, ... );
...
  parents.selectMuLambda( offsprings, Mu );
...
</div></pre>

<p>
	Tournament selection with tournament size <tt>Q</tt> 
	can be done as follows:
</p>

<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/Population.h>
...
  //
  // define the tournament size
  //
  const unsigned Q = 2;\\

  Population parents   ( ... );
  Population offsprings( ... );

...

  parents.selectTournament( offsprings, Q );
..
</div></pre>
