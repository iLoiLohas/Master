<h1>The EALib</h1>

<p>
	The EALib C++ library is part of the Shark library. It contains
	classes for the implementation of evolutionary algorithms and related
	techniques.  
	The whole package is intended to be used in evolutionary algorithms
	research.  Therefore, the main emphasis has been put on providing as
	much flexibility and extendability as possible.  Efficiency has been
	another major design issue, but has been sacrificed where it conflicts
	with flexibility.
</p>

<p>
	A basic introduction with sample code can be found in the
	report <em> EALib: A C++ class library for evolutionary
	algorithms</em>.  Neither this report nor this shorter tutorial is
	complete. They serve as starting points for exploring and working with
	the EALib.
	The library also includes many example programs, which can be
	used as templates for own programs to do evolutionary optimization.
