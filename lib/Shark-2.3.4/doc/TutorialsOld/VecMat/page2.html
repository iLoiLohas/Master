<h1>Operations on Vectors and Matrices</h1>
<p>
	Until now, vectors and matrices are just arrays with fixed
	number of dimensions. However, the need for
	these classes arises from something different, namely from
	the implementation of standard algebraic operations on these
	objects.
</p>

<h2>Vector Access</h2>
<p>
	It is regularly convenient to interpret a matrix as composed
	of (row or column) vectors. Therefore, the Matrix
	<tt>operator []</tt> is overloaded and returns a Vector
	(instead or an ArrayReference&lt;double&gt;).
</p>

<h2>Algebraic Operations</h2>
<p>
	The operations addition, subtraction and (matrix) multiplication
	are defined. It is possible to multiply a matrix with a vector
	or with another matrix. Scalar multiplication is defined, too,
	such that all operations of the algebra of matrices can be
	carried out with the corresponding C++ operators +, -, and *
	as expected. The compound assignment operators +=, -=, and *=
	are defined whenever they make sense.
</p>
<p>
	Two special operators remain:
	The operator * for two vectors computes the standard inner
	product (scalar product), while the operator % of two vectors
	computes their outer product, resulting in a matrix.
</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, vectors provide their Euclidean norm or squared
	norm, or are easily normalizable through the member functions
	<ul>
		<li><tt>double Vector::norm()</tt></li>
		<li><tt>double Vector::norm2()</tt></li>
		<li><tt>void Vector::normalize()</tt></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>
	Assume we want to compute the value of a quadratic function
</p>
<p align="center">
	<i><b>f(x) = x<sup>T</sup> M x + v<sup>T</sup>x + c</b></i>
</p>
<p>
	with a 3x3-matrix M, a 3-vector v and a constant c. Without the
	classes Vector and Matrix the code could look like this:
</p>

<pre><div class="code">    class QuadFunc
    {
        Array&lt;double&gt; M;
        Array&lt;double&gt; v;
        double c;

    public:
        QuadFunc()
        : M(3, 3), v(3)
        {
            ... [set entries of M] ...
            ... [set entries of v] ...
            ... [set c] ...
        }

        double eval(const Array&lt;double&gt;&amp; x)
        {
            return vecMatVec(x, M, x) + scalarProduct(v, x) + c;
        }
    };
</div></pre>

With the classes Vector and Matrix the example becomes:

<pre><div class="code">    class QuadFunc
    {
        Matrix M;
        Vector v;
        double c;

    public:
        QuadFunc()
        : M(3, 3), v(3)
        {
            ... [set entries of M] ...
            ... [set entries of v] ...
            ... [set c] ...
        }

        double eval(const Vector&amp; x)
        {
            return x * (M * x) + v * x + c;
        }
    };
</div></pre>

<p>
	The obvious advantage of the second version is that
	intuitive C++ operators replace C-style functions, saving
	the need to remember their names and calling conventions.
