<h1>Vector and Matrix Classes</h1>
<p>
	The LinAlg module builds on Arrays, in particular on the
	class <tt>Array&lt;double&gt;</tt>, to represent both
	Vectors and Matrices. Alternatively, LinAlg provides a
	more object oriented interface to these concept in terms
	of two specialized classes:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<tt>class Vector : public Array&lt;double&gt;</tt>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<a href="../../LinAlg/class_vector.html" target="_blank">[reference]</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<tt>class Matrix : public Array&lt;double&gt;</tt>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<a href="../../LinAlg/class_matrix.html" target="_blank">[reference]</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	This tutorial teaches how these classes are used and
	introduces their capabilities beyond simple arrays.
</p>

<p>
	The classes are accessible after including the header

<h2>Array Access</h2>
<p>
	As a rule of thumb you may think of Vectors as
	one-dimensional instances of <tt>Array&lt;double&gt;</tt>
	while, of course, a Matrix object is two-dimensional.
	All access operations from the superclass
	<tt>Array&lt;double&gt;</tt> are available, but some
	functionalities have been overloaded in order to
	reflect the special needs of vectors and matrices.
</p>

<h2>Size information</h2>
<p>
	In contrast to simple Arrays, the dimensions of vectors
	and matrices are fixed. Therefore it is impossible to
	construct these objects with a default constructur.
	Instead, the programmer is forced to provide the
	necessary size information already at construction time.
	Of course it is possible to resize vectors and matrices
	later, but the number of dimensions is always kept correct.
