<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial demonstrates the usage of the LinAlg package with its
	probably most frequent application, the inversion of a matrix.
</p>

<h2>The Inversion Problem</h2>
<p>
	The inverse of a square matrix <img src="f1.png"> is, if it exists,
	the unique matrix <img src="f2.png"> that fulfills <img src="f3.png">
	where <b>I</b> is the unit matrix. In Shark, matrices are represented as
	<a target="_parent" href="../Array/index.html">Arrays</a>.
	However, most programming languages including C++ do not support
	computations involving vectors and matrices. Further, matrix
	inversion is a non-trivial numerically challenging process,
	especially for matrices &quot;close&quot; to non-invertible matrices
	with low rank.
	Therefore the LinAlg packages offers powerful and efficient methods
	for matrix inversion.
</p>

<p>
	For non-square matrices <img src="f4.png"> inversion does not make
	sense. Instead, we are usually interested in the
	<a target="_blank"
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore-Penrose_pseudoinverse">Moore-Penrose
	pseudoinverse</a>, as the pseudoinverse can also be computed
	for non-invertible square matrices. Therefore it is always
	safe to compute the pseudoinverse instead of the inverse. In
	LinAlg, this is done with the function
	<tt>g_inverse</tt> or with the frontend <tt>invert</tt>.
	Alternatively, <tt>g_inverseCholesky</tt> can be used, which implements the algorithm described in:	
<div class=publication>P. Courrieu.
Fast computation of Moore-Penrose inverse matrices. <em>Neural Information Processing-Letters and Reviews</em> <vol>8</vol>(2), pp. 25-29, 2005</div>
  If the transposed of the matrix times the matrix has full rank, then
  <tt>g_inverseMoorePenrose</tt> is an alternative, fast way to
	compute the general inverse.
</p>

<p>
	Symmetric matrices fulfilling <img src="f5.png"> are an important  special
	case. The LinAlg
	package provides the special <tt>invertSymm</tt> method for the
	inversion of symmetric matrices. If the  matrix is additionally 
	positive definite, the efficient function <tt>invertSymmPositiveDefinite</tt>
	can be used.
