<h1>Welcome to the installation tutorial!</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial explains how to install the Shark
	machine learning library on Unix systems including
	Linux and Mac&nbsp;OS.
</p>

<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>
	The tutorial is designed for users of the Shark library
	who just downloaded the sources and need help for the
	proper installation.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
	The installation can be carried out either as a user
	or as an administrator/root user.
</p>
<p>
	The size of the fully installed library varies depending
	on your platform and your needs. In doubt, be sure to
	have at least 100&nbsp;MB of disk space available for the
	installation.
</p>
<p>
	As the Shark library is distributed as C++ source code
	you need a C++ compiler for the installation. Because
	Shark makes full use of modern language features like
	templates and exceptions be sure that your compiler is
	up to date. The GNU compilers starting from version&nbsp;3
	should not cause problems.
