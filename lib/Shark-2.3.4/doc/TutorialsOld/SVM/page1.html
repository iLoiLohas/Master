<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial explains how to ...
	<ul>
		<li>train a Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
		<li>classify data with the SVM</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	The tutorial is designed for users of the Shark library who want to
	use Support Vector Machines in their own programs.  As Shark is a
	C++ library, it is necessary that you feel comfortable with the C++
	language.  This tutorial requires no experience in programming with
	Shark. Of course it is helpful it you are already familiar with the
	structure of the
	<a target="_parent" href="../ReClaM-Architecture/index.html">ReClaM</a>
	module and with the
	<a target="_parent" href="../Array/index.html">Array</a> library.
</p>

<p>
	It is assumed that you are familiar with the concept
	of a support vector machine, at least at a user level.
	In particular, you should know about labeled training
	data, regularization, and kernel functions.
