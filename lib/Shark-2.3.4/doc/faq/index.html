<h2>General</h2>

<table class="tab1">
<tr><td width="30%">
	<h3>Question</h3>
	What are the differences between Shark and other libraries? Why should I use Shark?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<p>
		Shark is a native C++ library designed for development and
		real-world application of state-of-the-art machine learning and
		optimization algorithms. The library has a history of more than 10
		years of successful applications. It is actively supported and still
		growing. We are continuously extending and improving the algorithms
		in various domains of machine learning and computational
		intelligence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flexibility and speed are the main design criteria (see the
		question "How fast is the Shark?").
		We think that its flexibility and extensibility makes Shark stand
		out from other libraries.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is self-contained and offers computational intelligence
		techniques such as single- and multi-objective evolutionary
		algorithms and neural networks as well as kernel-based machine
		learning methods and classical optimization techniques in a coherent
		framework. This is unique.
	</p>

	<p>
		Shark is an object-oriented software library and to use it
		requires knowledge in C++ programming. If a graphical user interface
		is important for you, you may go for other machine learning software
		(or feel free to contribute such a front-end for Shark).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Shark implements a lot of powerful algorithms not available in
		any other machine learning library, of course in particular
		methods based on the research of the developers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some highlights:
		<ul>
			<li>The Shark SVM is the only SVM package implementing the fastest
				SMO-based learning algorithm for dense large-scale problems
				(using hybrid maximum gain working set selection).</li>
			<li>Shark provides a variety of model-selection algorithms for SVMs,
				for example gradient-based optimization of the kernel-target
				alignment, which is not available in any other library.</li>
			<li>Shark provides a large collection of efficient gradient-based
				optimization techniques, for example the frequently applied
				iRprop+, a fast and robust method not available in other
				machine learning libraries.</li>
			<li>We do not know any software library for single-objective
				evolutionary algorithms that comes close to the EALib in terms
				of variety and quality of algorithms for real-valued
				optimization.</li>
			<li>To our knowledge, the MOO-EALib is the most comprehensive
				library for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The
				efficient implementation of the hypervolume metric (S or
				Lebesgue measure) and of the powerful MO-CMA-ES are special
				features.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Question</h3>
	How fast is the Shark?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3> 
	Shark is a C++ library, because we aim at high performance.
	 Flexibility and speed are the main design criteria of the
	library. However, sometimes these objectives are conflicting and in
	some cases we had to sacrifice speed for flexibility. For example:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Support Vector Machine (SVMs) were added after examining the
			best implementations we could find on the web. In Shark, the
			kernel function is an object passed to the learning machine
			during runtime, while in the competing SVM code the kernel is
			a fixed function and you have to recompile the code if you want
			to change it. Thus, for medium sized problems, Shark is a negligible
			bit slower, because of the object-oriented architecture. However,
			because Shark is the only library implementing a special strategy
			(HMG working set selection) for large-scale problems, it is
			significantly faster than the competing library for large datasets.
		</li>
		<li>
			The modular architecture of ReClaM allows you to instantiate
			neural networks (NNs) with arbitrary topology, different error
			functions, and various learning algorithms during runtime. This
			modular architecture results in communication costs. Further,
			the NNs rely on Shark's convenient Array data structure, which
			is appropriate for dense structures and dense data, but not
			optimal for sparse data. Thus, there may be faster network
			implementations, however, the highly efficient learning algorithms
			in ReClaM compensate for that. And ReClaM offers to export NNs
			after training as independent, plain C source code, which is as
			fast as it can get.
		</li>
	</ul>

	Some benchmark examples:

	<ul>
		<li>
		We did a simple test to demonstrate the performance of
		the SVM quadratic program solver, compared to LIBSVM (which is the
		best reference available). We generated a toy dataset as follows:
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;ReClaM/ArtificialDistributions.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Chessboard chess(3, 4);
    Dataset ds(chess, 100000, 0);
    ds.Save("chessboard.shark.data", true, false, "ascii");
    ds.SaveLIBSVM("chessboard.libsvm.data", true, false);
}
</div></pre>
    This poses a very difficult problem for SMO-based solvers and the
	  problem size makes sure that the initial kernel matrix does not fit
	into memory, such that the HMG working set selection strategy is
	active in Shark.
	We ran both LIBSVM&nbsp;2.85 and Shark&nbsp;2.1.0 on this problem
	with the settings
	<ul>
		<li>C-SVM with 1-norm slack penalty, C=1,000,000</li>
		<li>Gaussian RBF kernel with parameter gamma=1</li>
		<li>256&nbsp;MB of kernel cache (default for the Shark SVM)</li>
		<li>Accuracy epsilon=0.001 (default)</li>
	</ul>
	The training times on a 3&nbsp;GHz intel machine running Fedora Linux
	were
	<ul>
		<li>31493 seconds (about 08:45) for Shark&nbsp;2.1.0</li>
		<li>40902 seconds (about 11:22) for LIBSVM&nbsp;2.85</li>
	</ul>
	In fact, for large scale problems (where speed really matters) the
	Shark solver profits from its cache-friendly HMG working set
	selection algorithm.
</li>
<li>
Not only in ReClaM, but also in the EALib and MOO-EAlib performance
is an issue.
For example, the functions for computing the hypervolume  (Lebesgue measure) in the MOO-EALib are pretty
fast. Let us consider the benchmark data set <a href="http://www.wfg.csse.uwa.edu.au/hypervolume/zipfiles/random_3d.zip">ran.40000pts.3d.1</a> provided by the Walking Fish Group.
It contains 40000 non-dominated  points in three dimensions. 
Running the implementation of the algorithm by Overmars and Yap on
a MacBook with 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
and 2GB RAM takes 4.18652 seconds to compute the hypervolume.

	<h3>Question</h3>
	Do I need root/Administrator access to install the Shark library?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	No, root/Administrator access is not required.
	However, if you want to install the library to a central location
	(like /usr/lib/ on Linux) you will of course need write access to
	that directory.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="30%">
	<h3>Question</h3>
	I get an &quot;internal compiler error&quot;.</br>
	What can I do?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	Under Windows using the Microsoft Developer Studio this error
	appears regularly without any obvious reason. You can do the
	following:
	<ul>
		<li>Be sure to have all service packs installed.</li>
		<li>Delete all temporary files and restart the compilation in batch mode.</li>
	</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="30%">
	<h3>Question</h3>
	Do I need Qt and Qwt?</br>
	Where can I get these libraries?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	No, you do not need these libraries unless you want to compile the graphical examples.
	The libraries are available from:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/">Qwt</a></li>
	</ul>

<h2>Packages</h2>

<table class="tab1">
<tr><td width="30%">
	<h3>Question</h3>
	What happened to the Fuzzy library?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3> The Fuzzy library for multi-valued logic and fuzzy
	control, which was available as an add-on package, was removed from
	the library some years ago. Recently the library was revised and we
	included an easy version into the current release. However, the
	Fuzzy module is still in the beta stage.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="30%">
	<h3>Question</h3>
	What happened to the [...] library, the [...] add-on package, the function [...]?
</td><td>
	<h3>Answer</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Some libraries and functions were dropped in Shark
		2.0.0, either because they were not used by many people,
		the implemented algorithms were outdated, or the code did not pass
		the code review.
		</li>
		<li>In Shark 2.1.0, all libraries were merged into one big Shark library.
		Noone seemed to install just one component of Shark and the different libraries
		required a lot of typing in Makefiles etc.
		</li>
		<li>
		The add-on packages are no longer maintained
		together with the main library.
		</li>
		<li>
		In Shark 2.1.1 the GUI
		example package was added to the main library package.
		</li>
		</ul>
