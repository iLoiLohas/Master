<h1>Changed ReClaM Architecture</h1>

<p>
The purpose of this page is to illustrate the new ReClaM
architecture introduced in Shark version 1.5.0 and to explain
its benefits for the software development process. To give a
concise overview we start with the traditional structure and
then describe the design goals and the realization of the new
architecture.
</p>

<h2>Overview of the Old Architecture</h2>

<p>
ReClaM versions up to 1.4.x were based on the ModelInterface
class. This class defined interfaces for a model, that is, a
parameterized family of functions, and an error function used
for optimization. Further, it had member variables dedicated to
the storage of the model parameters (usually called network
weights) and the derivative of the model output and the error
w.r.t. these parameters. There was no explicit optimizer
interface.
</p>

<p>
ReClaM was a collection of classes interiting ModelInterface
to provide the functionality of either a parameterized model, an
error function, or an optimization algorithm. In some classes
the model and the error function were combined for efficiency
reasons.
</p>

<p>
Every ReClaM program introduced a class inheriting from three
ModelInterface based classes: a model, an error function and an
optimizer. There was no formal way to distinguish these roles.
The communication was mainly organized through member variables,
such that there was no correlation between the lifetime of these
variables and the validity of their values.
</p>

<p>
Besides the formal logical inconsistency of an object <i>being</i>
a model, an error function, and its own optimizer at the same
time, there was the major drawback that late binding could not
be realized within this architecture. In practice, if a network
was trained with the mean squared error and it has to be tested
on the classification error, a class called ErrorMeasures was
inherited additional to the three ModelInterface based classes.
This class provided a number of common test error measures. This
proceeding was not only dissatisfactory, it even lead to
multiple implementations of error functions, once for training
and once for testing. Further, the need for a ModelInterface to
realize an error function lead to useless empty implementations
in some cases, for example when models needed to be combined.
</p>

<p>
The whole ReClaM package was clearly biased towards the special
needs of a neural network library. Many variable names indicated
this special purpose. These names are not well suited for the
extension of the library to kernel based methods like support
vector machines, and to model selection methods. Nevertheless,
most ReClaM components are well suited for general purpose
optimization problems.
</p>

<h2>Overview of the New Architecture</h2>

<p>
The new architecture tries to avoid the pitfalls outlined above.
In particular, the following properties are provided:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most important: The architecture allows for late binding of
		all ReClaM components.</li>
	<li>The class hierarchy represents the roles of the classes
		more accurately.</li>
	<li>The derivative variables are not stored beyond their usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The ModelInterface class was replaced by the three new
base classes <b>Model</b>, <b>ErrorFunction</b> and <b>Optimizer</b>.
These classes define all interfaces needed for the communication
between the components. Most of the ReClaM classes inherit exactly
one of these base classes. In the new architecture the three classes
are connected quite loosely in order to allow for late binding.
An optimizer does not know the error function to descend and an
error function does not know which model to evaluate. This leads to
slightly more overhead in the interfaces, because a model must be
provided to compute an error function and both model and error
function must be provided to an optimizer.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Model</b> class basically holds a list of adaptable parameters.
It provides access to these parameter through appropriate methods:
getParameter and setParameter. This allows models to organize the
linear list of parameters in a better suited fashion (for example in
a weight matrix) and on the other hand allows optimizers to access
the parameters in a standard way. Most models support the computation
of outputs from inputs, and the computation of the derivative of these
outputs w.r.t. the model parameters. The derivative computation
provides the derivative as a parameter by reference, not as a member
variable.
</p>

<p>
The <b>ErrorFunction</b> class needs a model to compute an error
value or an error derivative w.r.t. the model parameters. It usually
calls the model to compute outputs for the given inputs and then
compares these outputs to target values. As for the model, the
derivative of the error w.r.t. the model parameters is communicated
as a parameter by reference.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Optimizer</b> class defines a common interface for all
optimizers. In the old architecture, each optimizer defined its
own interface resulting in unnecessary changes to be made when
the optimizer was exchanged. The new interface requires a model and
an error function object as additional parameters to every
optimizer iteration.
</p>

<p>
The new architecture explicitly allows for late binding. If a
network is to be trained using the mean squared error, a
MeanSquaredError object is created and passed as a parameter to
the optimizer. After the optimization the network performance can
be tested on the classification error, for examle by passing the
trained network to a WTA (winner takes all) object for evaluation.
Another possibility is to compose models as concatenated, nested
or parallel models. It is perfectly possible to define a model
composed of other models as components. These possibilities are
heavily used by meta models for kernel based methods and by some
kernel classes.
</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>
In the new ReClaM version there still exists a ModelInterface
class. It is inherited from Model and ErrorFunction and tries
to mimic the behavior of the original ModelInterface. However,
this class is only provided for compatibility with old code.
Its functionality can not be guaranteed, nor will there be
maintainance in the future. There is a detailed
<a href="ReClaM_MigrationGuide.html">Migration Guide</a>
available explaining the changes necessary to use the new
ReClaM architecture with old code.
