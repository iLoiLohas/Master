<h1>ReClaM Migration Guide</h1>

<p>
This article should answer the question how to adapt your source code
written for the old ReClaM class architecture (up to version 1.4.x)
to the new one (starting from version 1.5.0 and especially version
2.0.0 and later).
</p>

<h2>What has been changed?</h2>

<p>
Previously there was an almighty interface class called ModelInterface.
It's purpose was basically the communication between model, optimizer
and error function. Models (e.g. FFNet), optimizers (e.g. Rprop) and
error functions (e.g. MeanSquaredError) were derived classes of
ModelInterface. The ModelInterface class provided shared variables
that stored things like error gradients for all three components of the
classifier or function approximator. In practice an approximator for
example was set up by defining a new class that was derived from a
model, an optimizer and an error function.
</p>

<p>
This multiple inheritance was removed in the new architecture. The
old ModelInterface class was split into three new base classes called
Model, Optimizer, and ErrorFunction were created. The previously
existant classes like Rprop (optimizer) or FFNet (model) are derived
from their respective base classes.
</p>

<h2>How to change my source code?</h2>

<p>
A typical previous set up of an approximator (simpleFFNet example)
looks like this:
</p>

<div class="code">class MyNet: public FFNet, public IRpropPlus, public MeanSquaredError
{
    ...
}

int main()
{
    // define connection matrix
    Array<int> con(numberOfNeurons, numberOfNeurons + 1);

    ... // Here the connection matrix is initialized

    // create an instance of the new class using the connection matrix and specifying the number of input and output neruons
    MyNet net(2, 1, con);

    // initialize weight matrix
    net.initWeights(-0.1, 0.1); 

    ... // Here training data is created or loaded

    // initialize optimizer
    net.initRprop(0.01);

    for (unsigned epoch = 1; epoch <= numberOfLearningCycles; epoch++)
    {

        // optimizer is run with the given training data and parameters
        net.rprop(inputTrain, targetTrain, 1.2, .5, 50, 0);

        ...
    }

    ...

    // return error
    cout << "Error: " << net.error(inputTrain, targetTrain) << endl;

    // process single input pattern
    ...
    net.model(in, out);
    cout << "Input: " << in(0) << ", " << in(1) << endl;
    cout << "Output: " << out(0) << endl;
}
</div>

<p>
With the new architecture the creation of a new class is no longer needed.
An equivalent approximator is set up like this:
</p>

<div class="code">int main()
{
    // define connection matrix
    Array<int> con(numberOfNeurons, numberOfNeurons + 1);

    ... // Here the connection matrix is initialized

    // create objects for the three components of the approximator
    FFNet net(2, 1, con);
    IRpropPlus optimizer;
    MeanSquaredError error;

    // initialize the weight matrix of the network instance
    net.initWeights(-0.1, 0.1); 

    ... // Here training data is created or loaded

    // initialize optimizer
    optimizer.initUserDefined(net, 1.2, .5, 50, 0, 0.01);

    for (unsigned epoch = 1; epoch <= numberOfLearningCycles; epoch++)
    {

        // optimizer is run with the given training data and parameters
        optimizer.optimize(net, error, inputTrain, targetTrain);

        ...
    }

    ...

    // return error
    cout << "Error: " << error.error(net, inputTrain, targetTrain) << endl;

    // process single input pattern
    ...
    net.model(in, out);
    cout << "Input: " << in(0) << ", " << in(1) << endl;
    cout << "Output: " << out(0) << endl;
}
</div>

<p>
Instead of defining a new class that inherits from the model,
optimizer, and error function used for the approximator there
are now three seperate objects called net, optimizer, and error:
</p>

<div class="code">FFNet net(2, 1, con);
IRpropPlus optimizer;
MeanSquaredError error;
</div>

<p>
The initialization of the connection matrix and weights is still
the same. But now the optimizer needs to be initialized because
it doesn't "know" a priori which model to optimize. Also the
optimizer parameters that were previously set when the optimizer
was actually called now have to be initialized before the
optimization:
</p>

<div class="code">optimizer.initUserDefined(net, 1.2, .5, 50, 0, 0.01);
</div>

<p>
It is also possible to init the optimizer parameters with default
values using:
</p>

<div class="code">optimizer.init(net);
</div>

<p>
Of course this also means that the parameters are no longer set
when the optimizer is called. The optimizer now needs a model to
optimize and an error function to use for the optimization instead.
An input and target pattern set are still required of course.
</p>

<div class="code">optimizer.optimize(net, error, inputTrain, targetTrain);
</div>

<p>
Similar the MeanSquaredError object needs the network object as an
additional parameter:
</p>

<div class="code">cout << "Error: " << error.error(net, inputTrain, targetTrain) << endl;
</div>

<p>
The last 5 boxes basically show all the changes required to migrate
the code shown above.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
To adapt your source code remind the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Instead of creating an instance or a sub-class of
		ModelInterface create instances or sub-classes of Model,
		Optimizer, and ErrorFunction. If you want to
		override a virtual method like the activation function
		of a neural network you can still just inherit from the
		class and override that function like you did it with
		ModelInterface.</li>
	<li>Change the initialization of the optimizer to
		either the standard initialization (init(...)) or use
		the user defined version.</li>
	<li>Replace the call of the optimizer with the optimize(...)
		method, adding the model and the error function as
		parameters.</li>
	<li>Change the calculation of errors using the error object
		with the error(...) method, providing the model as a
		parameter.</li>
</ul>
