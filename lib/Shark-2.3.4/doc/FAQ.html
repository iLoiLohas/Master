  <h1>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
  <p>
  The following list of frequently asked questions may prove helpful
  if you experience any problems with the Shark machine learning library.
  Please consult this FAQ before reporting any problems or bugs.
  </p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  Is there a mailing list available for users of the Shark library.
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>
  Yes, the mailing list is available at <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/shark-project-user">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/shark-project-user</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Question</h3>
  What are the differences between Shark and other libraries? Why should I use Shark?
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>
  Shark is a native C++ library designed for development and
  real-world application of state-of-the-art machine learning and
  optimization algorithms. The library has a history of more than 10
  years of successful applications. It is actively supported and still
  growing. We are continuously extending and improving the algorithms
  in various domains of machine learning and computational
  intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
  Flexibility and speed are the main design criteria (see the
  question "How fast is the Shark?").
  We think that its flexibility and extensibility makes Shark stand
  out from other libraries.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is self-contained and offers computational intelligence
  techniques such as single- and multi-objective evolutionary
  algorithms and neural networks as well as kernel-based machine
  learning methods and classical optimization techniques in a coherent
  framework. This is unique.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Shark is an object-oriented software library and to use it
  requires knowledge in C++ programming. If a graphical user interface
  is important for you, you may go for other machine learning software
  (or feel free to contribute such a front-end for Shark).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Shark implements a lot of powerful algorithms not available in
  any other machine learning library, of course in particular
  methods based on the research of the developers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Some highlights:
  <ul>
    <li>The Shark SVM is the only SVM package implementing the fastest
    SMO-based learning algorithm for dense large-scale problems
    (using hybrid maximum gain working set selection).</li>
    <li>Shark provides a variety of model-selection algorithms for SVMs,
    for example gradient-based optimization of the kernel-target
    alignment, which is not available in any other library.</li>
    <li>Shark provides a large collection of efficient gradient-based
    optimization techniques, for example the frequently applied
    iRprop+, a fast and robust method not available in other
    machine learning libraries.</li>
    <li>We do not know any software library for single-objective
    evolutionary algorithms that comes close to the EALib in terms
    of variety and quality of algorithms for real-valued
    optimization.</li>
    <li>To our knowledge, the MOO-EALib is the most comprehensive
    library for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The
    efficient implementation of the hypervolume metric (S or
    Lebesgue measure) and of the powerful MO-CMA-ES are special
    features.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  How fast is the Shark?

  <h3>Answer</h3> 
  Shark is a C++ library, because we aim at high performance.
  Flexibility and speed are the main design criteria of the
  library. However, sometimes these objectives are conflicting and in
  some cases we had to sacrifice speed for flexibility. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>
    Support Vector Machine (SVMs) were added after examining the
    best implementations we could find on the web. In Shark, the
    kernel function is an object passed to the learning machine
    during runtime, while in the competing SVM code the kernel is
    a fixed function and you have to recompile the code if you want
    to change it. Thus, for medium sized problems, Shark is a negligible
    bit slower, because of the object-oriented architecture. However,
    because Shark is the only library implementing a special strategy
    (HMG working set selection) for large-scale problems, it is
    significantly faster than the competing library for large datasets.
    </li>
    <li>
    The modular architecture of ReClaM allows you to instantiate
    neural networks (NNs) with arbitrary topology, different error
    functions, and various learning algorithms during runtime. This
    modular architecture results in communication costs. Further,
    the NNs rely on Shark's convenient Array data structure, which
    is appropriate for dense structures and dense data, but not
    optimal for sparse data. Thus, there may be faster network
    implementations, however, the highly efficient learning algorithms
    in ReClaM compensate for that. And ReClaM offers to export NNs
    after training as independent, plain C source code, which is as
    fast as it can get.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  Some benchmark examples:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
    We did a simple test to demonstrate the performance of
    the SVM quadratic program solver, compared to LIBSVM (which is the
    best reference available). We generated a toy dataset as follows:
    <pre><div class="code">#include &lt;ReClaM/ArtificialDistributions.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Chessboard chess(3, 4);
    Dataset ds(chess, 100000, 0);
    ds.Save("chessboard.shark.data", true, false, "ascii");
    ds.SaveLIBSVM("chessboard.libsvm.data", true, false);
}
</div></pre>
This poses a very difficult problem for SMO-based solvers and the
problem size makes sure that the initial kernel matrix does not fit
into memory, such that the HMG working set selection strategy is
active in Shark.
We ran both LIBSVM&nbsp;2.85 and Shark&nbsp;2.1.0 on this problem
with the settings
<ul>
  <li>C-SVM with 1-norm slack penalty, C=1,000,000</li>
  <li>Gaussian RBF kernel with parameter gamma=1</li>
  <li>256&nbsp;MB of kernel cache (default for the Shark SVM)</li>
  <li>Accuracy epsilon=0.001 (default)</li>
</ul>
The training times on a 3&nbsp;GHz intel machine running Fedora Linux
were
<ul>
  <li>31493 seconds (about 08:45) for Shark&nbsp;2.1.0</li>
  <li>40902 seconds (about 11:22) for LIBSVM&nbsp;2.85</li>
</ul>
In fact, for large scale problems (where speed really matters) the
Shark solver profits from its cache-friendly HMG working set
selection algorithm.
</li>
<li>
Not only in ReClaM, but also in the EALib and MOO-EAlib performance
is an issue.
For example, the functions for computing the hypervolume  (Lebesgue measure) in the MOO-EALib are pretty
fast. Let us consider the benchmark data set <a href="http://www.wfg.csse.uwa.edu.au/hypervolume/zipfiles/random_3d.zip">ran.40000pts.3d.1</a> provided by the Walking Fish Group.
It contains 40000 non-dominated  points in three dimensions. 
Running the implementation of the algorithm by Overmars and Yap on
a MacBook with 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
and 2GB RAM takes 4.18652 seconds to compute the hypervolume.

<h2>Installation</h2>


<h3>Question</h3>
How do I install the Shark library?

<h3>Answer</h3>
Please refer to the section <a href="GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a>.


<h3>Question</h3>
Do I need root/Administrator access to install the Shark library?

<h3>Answer</h3>
No, root/Administrator access is not required.
However, if you want to install the library to a central location
(like /usr/lib/ on Linux) you will of course need write access to
that directory.

<h3>Question</h3>
I get an &quot;internal compiler error&quot;.</br>
What can I do?

<h3>Answer</h3>
Under Windows using the Microsoft Developer Studio this error
appears regularly without any obvious reason. You can do the
following:
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to have all service packs installed.</li>
  <li>Delete all temporary files and restart the compilation in batch mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question</h3>
Do I need Qt and Qwt?</br>
Where can I get these libraries?

<h3>Answer</h3>
No, you do not need these libraries unless you want to compile the graphical examples.
The libraries are available from:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/">Qwt</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Question</h3>
I get strange warnings when I compile Shark using a certain Microsoft compiler.
What should I do?

<h3>Answer</h3>
Don't worry, ignore them.

<h2>Packages</h2>


<h3>Question</h3>
What happened to the Fuzzy library?

<h3>Answer</h3>
The Fuzzy library for multi-valued logic and fuzzy
control, which was available as an add-on package, was removed from
the library some years ago. Recently the library was revised and we
included an easy version into the current release. However, the
Fuzzy module is still in the beta stage.


<h3>Question</h3>
What happened to the [...] library, the [...] add-on package, the function [...]?

<h3>Answer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some libraries and functions were dropped in Shark
  2.0.0, either because they were not used by many people,
  the implemented algorithms were outdated, or the code did not pass
  the code review.
  </li>
  <li>In Shark 2.1.0, all libraries were merged into one big Shark library.
  Noone seemed to install just one component of Shark and the different libraries
  required a lot of typing in Makefiles etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  The add-on packages are no longer maintained
  together with the main library.
  </li>
  <li>
  In Shark 2.1.1 the GUI
  example package was added to the main library package.
  </li>
</ul>
