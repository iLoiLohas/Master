<h1>My First Arrays</h1>

<p>
	Arrays are basic dynamical data structures in Shark.  They are generic
	containers implemented using templates.  Arrays are most often used to
	handle numerical vectors/matrices/tensors.  They are resizable,
	parameter passing by value and assignment work properly, and range
	checks can be conducted at run-time.
</p>
<p>
	The Array class provides a lot of functions, which are
	described in the Array documentation. Only the most basic
	concepts are introduced in the following tutorial.
</p>
<p>
	In the first example, we define three Arrays.
</p>

<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;Array/Array.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Array&lt;double&gt; a, b, c;
    a.resize(3u);
    b.resize(3u);

    std::cout << a.ndim() << " " << a.dim(0) << std:endl;

    a = 1.;
    for(unsigned i=0; i&lt;b.dim(0); i++) b(i)=(i+1)/10.;

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</div></pre>

<p>
	The Arrays <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are resized to be one-dimensional
	and to have three elements. The member functions 
	<tt>ndim()</tt> and <tt>dim(n)</tt> return the number of dimensions and
	the number of elements in dimension <tt>n</tt>, respectively.
	That is, the output is:
</p>
<div class="shell">1 3
</div>

<p>
	Then every element of <tt>a</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt>, i.e., 
	<tt>a</tt> corresponds to the unit vector.
	The vector <tt>b</tt> is filled with the values 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.
</p>
<p>
	Note that round brackets are the typical way to index an Array element.
