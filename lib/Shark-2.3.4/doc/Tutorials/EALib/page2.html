<h1>Genes and Chromosomes</h1>

<p>
	Evolutionary algorithms are formulated in terms of populations,
	individuals, chromosomes, and genetic operators working on them.  In
	the EALib, Chromosomes,
	individuals, and populations are
	essentially sequences of items and are derived from the
	Standard Template Library class <tt>vector</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Basic Data Structures of Genes and Chromosomes</h2>

<p>
	The representation (genome) of an individual consists of a
	variable number of sequences (chomosomes) of variable length.
	These sequences may contain binary, integer, continuous values, or any
	other type of values (alleles). The base class
	<tt>Chromosome</tt> defines the common properties of all types of
	chromosomes.  Furthermore, it declares genetic operators which can be
	applied to any sequence of items such as crossover, inversion,
	duplication, rotation, translation.  The more specific operators like
	initialisation, mutation, and special forms of
	recombination, are defined in the derived template class
	<tt>ChromosomeT&lt; Type ></tt>. Some general operators, like input from
	streams and output to streams, depend on the special type of
	a chromosome and may not be defined for that type.  However, they are
	declared in the base class <tt>Chromosome</tt> to be accessible by any
	derived class.  Unless they are overloaded by the derived classes a
	call of these operators may cause the exception <tt>undefined
	operator</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Binary  Alleles</h2>
<p>
	Chromosomes with binary valued alleles are essentially strings of
	Boolean values. The class <tt>ChromosomeT&lt; bool ></tt> is
	derived from class <tt>Chromosome</tt> and class <tt>vector< bool ></tt>.
	All operators which are defined for class <tt>vector< bool ></tt> such
	as assignment, subscript, test for equality, and change of size are
	available for class <tt>ChromosomeT< bool ></tt> in the same way.
	Instances of class <tt>ChromosomeT< bool ></tt> can be used 
	when a binary representation is needed. Furthermore, some genetic
	operators specific for strings of boolean values like flipping
	particular alleles or interpreting the genome as a binary encoded
	floating point number are defined in this class.
</p>

<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/ChromosomeT.h>       
...
  ChromosomeT< bool > chrom( 10 ); // define chromosome with 10 alleles
  chrom.initialize( );             // initialize alleles with random values

  for( int i = 0; i < chrom.size( ); i++ ) {
    cout << "allele " << i << " = "
         << chrom[ i ];          // send ith allele to standard output
         << endl;
  }
...
</div></pre>

<h2>Integer Alleles</h2>
<p>
	Analogously, the class <tt>Chromosome< int ></tt> is derived from class
	<tt>Chromosome</tt> and class <tt>vector< int ></tt>.
	Alleles of an instance of <tt>ChromosomeT< int ></tt> may
	contain integer values as well as symbols.
</p>

<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/ChromosomeT.h>  
...
  ChromosomeT< int > chrom( 3 );   // define chromosome with 3 alleles
...
</div></pre>

<h2>Continuous Alleles</h2>
<p>
	The class <tt>ChromosomeT< double ></tt> is specially designed
	for continuous parameter optimisation problems. All variants of
	evolution strategies rely on this data type. A variety of mutation
	operators, mainly based on normally distributed random numbers, and
	special forms of recombination are implemented in this class.
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/ChromosomeT.h>  
...
  ChromosomeT< double > chrom( 20, 1.2 ); // define chromosome with 20
                                          // alleles with initial value 1.2
...
</div></pre>

<h2>User Defined Alleles</h2>
<p>
	For many tasks the standard types introduced above are not
	applicable, in particular if different basic types must be
	combined to represent a suitable chromosome or if additional
	complex methods must be available at chromosome level. Then
	it is recommended to derive a user defined sub-class from
	Chromosome or one of the ChromosomeT&lt;T&gt; classes.
