<h1>Fitness Functions</h1>
<p>
	In the previous example the fitness is computed by a static
	function. Sometimes it is convenient to have an object oriented
	framework in order to be able to apply late binding. In order
	to avoid function pointers the <tt>ObjectiveFunctionT&lt;T&gt;</tt>
	interface provides a pure virtual function for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
	For single-objective optimization (as considered throughout
	the EALib), fitness functions are real-valued functions on
	an arbitrary search space. Therefore, the <tt>ObjectiveFunctionT&lt;T&gt;</tt>
	template takes the search space representation as its
	template argument.
</p>
<p>
	This interface allows to obtain the fitness value for a given
	search point with the
	<tt>operator&nbsp;()&nbsp;(const&nbsp;T&amp;&nbsp;point)</tt>.
	For compatibility with the case of multi-objective optimization
	the more general function <tt>result</tt> needs to be
	overloaded by a concrete fitness function implementation.
</p>
<p>
	If the search space is a vector space (or represented as a
	tuple over some type) the sub-class <tt>ObjectiveFunctionVS&lt;T&gt;</tt>
	should be used, which uses <tt>T*</tt> to represent the search
	space. The following example function computes the squared
	distance to the origin.
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;EALib/ObjectiveFunction.h&gt;

class Sphere : public ObjectiveFunctionVS&lt;double&gt;
{
public:
    Sphere(unsigned d)
    : ObjectiveFunctionVS&lt;double&gt;(d, NULL)
    { m_name = "Sphere"; }

    ~Sphere() { }

    void result(double* const&amp; point, std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; value) {
        unsigned i;
        double sum = 0.;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; m_dimension; i++) sum += point[i]*point[i];
        value.resize(1);
        value[0] = sum;
        m_timesCalled++;
    }

    unsigned int objectives() const { return 1; }
};
</div></pre>

<p>
	Note the type construction of the first argument of the
	<tt>result</tt> function which is the resolution of the
	expression <tt>const T&amp;</tt> with <tt>T = double*</tt>.
	The member variable <tt>m_timesCalled</tt> simply counts how
	often the objective function was evaluated.
</p>
<p>
	The function computes the squared norm of the vector.
	Then it resizes the result to one entry (corresponding
	to a single objective as always in EALib) and returns
	the value in this field. The method <tt>objectives</tt>
	consequently returns the value <tt>1</tt>.
