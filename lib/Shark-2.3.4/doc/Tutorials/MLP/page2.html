<h1>Defining a Network Topology</h1>

<p>
	Now we define the topology of our neural network model.  We select a
	feed-forward neural network with a single hidden layer.  The default
	transfer functions are sigmoidal Fermi/logistic functions
	g(<i>x</i>)=1/(1+exp(-<i>x</i>)) mapping to [0,1].  According to the
	problem, the network has two input neurons and a single output neuron.
	There are different ways to define the topology of the network, for
	example one may specify the connection matrix directly. More convenient
	is usually the function <tt>createConnectionMatrix</tt>.
</p>
<pre><div class="code">#include &lt;Array/Array.h&gt;
<div class="newcode">#include &lt;ReClaM/FFNet.h&gt;
#include &lt;ReClaM/createConnectionMatrix.h&gt;</div>
int main()
{
  // just index variables
  unsigned i, j, k, t;
	
  // construct xor problem
  Array&lt;double&gt; trainInput(4, 2);
  Array&lt;double&gt; trainTarget(4, 1);
  for(k=0, i=0; i&lt;2; i++) {
    for(j=0; j&lt;2; j++) {
      trainInput(k, 0) = i;
      trainInput(k, 1) = j;
      trainTarget(k, 0) = (i+j) % 2;
      k++;
    }
  }<div class="newcode">
  // define topology
  unsigned inputs = 2;
  unsigned hidden = 2;
  unsigned outputs = 1;

  // create connection matrix 
  Array&lt;int&gt; con;
  createConnectionMatrix(con, 
                         inputs, hidden, outputs);

  // feed-forward neural network
  FFNet net(inputs, outputs, con);</div>
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</div></pre>
<p>
	The connection matrix is simply an integer <tt>Array</tt>, where one and zero
	indicate presence and absence of a connection, respectively.
	The function <tt>createConnectionMatrix</tt> gets the connection matrix,
	the number of input neurons, the number of hidden neurons, and the number
	of output neurons as arguments.
</p>

<p>
	The resulting connection matrix is used in the constructor of
	the <tt>FFNet</tt>, the feed-forward neural network model.
	By writing
</p>
<pre><div class="code">  writeArray(con, std::cout);
</div></pre>
<p>
	we can output the connection matrix,
	which looks like this:
</p>
<div class="shell">0       0       0       0       0       0
0       0       0       0       0       0
1       1       0       0       0       1
1       1       0       0       0       1
1       1       1       1       0       1</div>
<p>
	The first two lines refer to the input neurons, which get no input
	from other neurons.  Line three and four refer to the hidden neurons,
	which receive input from the input neurons.  The last line is the
	output neuron, which gets input from the input and hidden neurons, The
	last column refers to the bias neuron, which is connected to the
	hidden neurons and the output unit.  As the bias neuron never gets
	input, there is no line for the bias neuron (that is why the matrix in
	not symmetric).
</p>

<p>
	If two hidden layers were desired, with 3 and 2 neurons, respectively,
	one would simply write:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">
  // define topology
  unsigned inputs = 2;
  unsigned firstHiddenLayer = 3;
  unsigned secondHiddenLayer = 2;
  unsigned outputs = 1;


  // create connection matrix 
  Array&lt;int&gt; con;
  createConnectionMatrix(con, 
                         inputs, firstHiddenLayer, secondHiddenLayer, outputs);
</div></pre>

<p>
	The function <tt>createConnectionMatrix</tt> has four Boolean parameters
	specifying the connectivity, which are set to true by default.
	The example with one hidden layer could also be written as:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">
  // define topology
  unsigned inputs = 2;
  unsigned hidden = 2;
  unsigned outputs = 1;

  bool connectConsecutiveLayers = true;
  bool connectInputsOutputs     = true;
  bool connectAll               = true;
  bool useBiasNeuron            = true;

  // create connection matrix 
  Array&lt;int&gt; con;
  createConnectionMatrix(con, 
                         inputs, hidden, outputs,
                         connectConsecutiveLayers, connectInputsOutputs,
                         connectAll, useBiasNeuron);

  // feed-forward neural network
  FFNet net(inputs, outputs, con);
</div></pre>
<p>
	The first flag indicates whether all connections between consecutive
	layers should be added to the connection matrix.  The second flag
	switches shortcut connections between inputs and outputs on. If the
	third flag is true, all possible feed-forward connection obeying the
	layer structure are set (this implies the connections between
	consecutive layers and the shortcuts). The final parameter indicates
	whether a bias parameter (i.e., a bias neuron) should be used.
</p>

<p>The alternative setting</p>
<pre><div class="code">
  bool connectConsecutiveLayers = true;
  bool connectInputsOutputs     = false;
  bool connectAll               = false;
  bool useBiasNeuron            = false;
</div></pre>
<p>yields the connection matrix:</p>
<div class="shell">0       0       0       0       0       0
0       0       0       0       0       0
1       1       0       0       0       0
1       1       0       0       0       0
0       0       1       1       0       0
<div>
