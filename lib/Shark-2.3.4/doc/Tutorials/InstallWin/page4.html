<h1>Prepare Own Programs</h1>

<p>
	To use Shark in your programs you need to make the header files
	and the library known to the compiler and linker, respectively.
	Both settings are done in the project settings dialog.
	This tutorial provides screenshots of Developer Studio&nbsp;6.0.
	In Developer Studio&nbsp;.net the same settings may be located
	in slightly different places in the project settings dialog.
</p>

<h2>Include Path</h2>
<p>
	Open the tab <b>C/C++</b> in the project properties dialog and
	add <b>[shark-root]\include</b> as an additional include path.

</p>

<h2>Library Path and Name</h2>
<p>
	Then switch to the <b>Link</b> tab and add the library name
	<b>Shark.lib</b> to the list of libraries used.
	Set <b>[shark-root]\lib\WinNT\Release</b> or
	<b>[shark-root]\lib\WinNT\Debug</b> as an additional library path.
