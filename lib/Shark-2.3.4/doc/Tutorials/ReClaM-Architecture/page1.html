<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial will explain the software architecture of the
	ReClaM module and demonstrate its flexibility.
</p>

<h1>Architecture Overview</h1>
<p>
	The architecture of the ReClaM module is designed for the solution
	of general optimization problems appearing in the training of
	parameterized models. The model, the optimization problem, and the
	solution strategy define the three abstract base classes that make
	up the structure of ReClaM. Most classes fulfill one or more of
	these interfaces:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Model</li>
	<li>ErrorFunction</li>
	<li>Optimizer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Models</h2>
<p>
	Models fulfill a two-fold purpose: A model defines a parameterized
	family of funtions, for example a linear function or a feed forward
	neural network. The Model class provides a standarized interface for
	the access and the manipulation of these parameters. Of course, for
	a fixed parameter setting the model can compute the output of the
	function it represents for any given input. In the context of
	learning the model computes the prediction given a pattern.
</p>

<h2>Error Functions</h2>
<p>
	In this context, machine learning reduces to the search for good or
	optimal parameters of the model, in order to make it predict
	properties of patterns correctly. This happens in a data driven way
	as follows: We define an error measure and present data to the
	machine. Then we use an error function to compare the output of the
	machine with the target output (or ground truth). This function can
	be the mean squared error in a regression problem or just the number
	of wrong predictions in a classification task. The goal of learning
	is then to find model parameters which minimize the error.
	The ErrorFunction class defines a general interface for the
	computation of any error measure, given a model as well as data.
</p>

<h2>Optimizer</h2>
<p>
	It is still unclear how the parameters are to be modified such that
	the error of the model is reduced. This is the task of an
	optimization strategy, ranging from simple grid search over
	evolutionary algorithms to iterative gradient descent techniques.
	The Optimizer class encapsulates this functionality.
</p>

	Please consult the
	<a target="_parent" href="../../ReClaM/index.html">ReClaM documentation</a>
	for more information and a description of the most important models,
	error functions, and optimization strategies available.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of the Design</h2>
<p>
	The software design described above allows for a great flexibility
	in the solution of a particular learning problem. The main reason is
	the strict modularity, which enforces the three components to
	communicate through the interfaces defined by the base classes.
	You will usually pick the model which suits your needs or write your
	own, maybe as a subclass of an existing model. Then you pick an
	error function and an optimization strategy, but as your needs
	change it is very easy to exchange a single component without
	touching the others. It is even possible to realize late binding,
	that is, to combine components at run time, possibly due to user
	input. Further the architecture makes it a simple task to combine
	models in various ways.
