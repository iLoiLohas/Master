<h1>Compilation of GUI Examples</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial will explain how to compile the
	GUI example programs which come with the ReClaM module under Unix-based systems.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
	It is assumed that the Shark library is properly installed
	on your system. For help on this topic you can consult the
	<a href="../Install/index.html" target="_parent">Installation
	Tutorial</a>. Depending on your installation, it may be necessary
	to set the
	 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker#Unix_and_Unix-likes">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</a>
	(or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker#Mac_OS_X">DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</a>
	under MacOS)
	<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#UNIX">environment variable</a>
	to the directory where the Shark library is installed.
</p>
<p>
	For all GUI examples,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a>
	is required. It is assumed that <tt>qmake</tt> is installed correctly.
</p>
<p>
	For some of the GUI examples, additionally
	<a target="_blank" href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/">Qwt</a>
	is needed. Depending on your installation, it may be necessary to
	set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variable
	to the directory where the Qwt library is installed.
</p>

<h2>The GUI Example Directory</h2>
<p>
	The ReClaM GUI  example programs are located in the
	<b>examples/ReClaM/QT/</b> directory under the Shark root
	directory <b>[SharkRoot]</b> (i.e., where you extracted
	the library).
