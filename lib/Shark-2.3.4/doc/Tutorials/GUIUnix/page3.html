<h1>Building the Examples</h1>

<p>
After the corresponding project file is adapted,
the example program, say <tt>classification</tt>,
can be simply build by:
</p>

<div class="shell">&gt; cd <b>[SharkRoot]</b>/examples/ReClaM/QT
&gt; qmake classification.pro
&gt; make 
</div>
<p>
	If you get the error message
</p>
<div class="shell">./classification: error while loading shared libraries: 
libShark.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</div>
<p>
	you have to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH under MacOS)
	environment variable to the directory where the Shark library is
	installed.  A similar problem, which is solved analogously, occurs
	if the program requires Qwt and you did not set the path to the Qwt
	library correctly,
</p>

<p>Then start the program</p>

<div class="shell">./classification 
</div>

<p>
	and you should see something like this:
