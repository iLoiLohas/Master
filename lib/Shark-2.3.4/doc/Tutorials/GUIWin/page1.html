<h1>Compilation of GUI Examples</h1>
<p>
	This tutorial will explain how to compile the
	GUI example programs which come with the ReClaM module under Windows.
</p>
<p>
	The installation procedure may differ depending on which version of
	Microsoft Windows and which compiler is used. We tested Visual C++
	Express 2005 under Windows 2000 and Visual C++ Express 2008 under
	Windows Vista.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
	It is assumed that the Shark library is already built as described in the 
	<a href="../InstallWin/index.html" target="_parent">Installation 
	Tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For all GUI examples,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt4</a> is 
    required (<b>note</b>: in this tutorial the <i>commercial version 4.3.3</i> is assumed).
</p>
<p>
	For some of the GUI examples, additionally
	<a target="_blank" href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net/">Qwt 5.0.2</a>
	is needed.
</p>



<h2>The GUI Example Directory</h2>
<p>
	The ReClaM GUI  example programs are located in the
	<b>examples/ReClaM/QT/</b> directory under the Shark root
	directory <b>[SharkRoot]</b> (i.e., where you extracted
	the library).
