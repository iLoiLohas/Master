<h1>Solving the TSP with genetic algorithms</h1>
<p>
This tutorial introduces an benchmark problem for optimization tasks known as the travelling salesman problem and illustrates how to solve it with a genetic algorithm. For an introduction to evolutionary algorithms read the <a target="_parent" href="../EALib/index.html">Introduction to EALib</a>  tutorial first.
</p>

<p>
	This example reproduces a classical experiment  and does not
	reflect the state-of-the-art in evolutionary algorithms for TSP.

<p>
	This is an advanced example showing how to implement a tailored 
	evolutionary algorithm using the EALib.

<h2>An exemplary problem: The travelling salesman problem</h2>

<p>
	The traveling salsman problem is a combinatorial optimization task. A
	salesman is supposed to visit <i>n</i> cities. Each travelling connection
	is associated with a cost (i.e. the time fot the trip). The problem is
	to find the cheapest round-route that visits each city exactly once
	and returns to the starting point.
</p>
<p>
	The figure shows the example used in this tutorial with 10 cities.
