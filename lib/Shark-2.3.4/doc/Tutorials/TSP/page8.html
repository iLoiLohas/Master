<h2>Generate offspring III</h2>

<p>
	First we ensure that the starting and ending indices for the
	crossover are valid:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">  unsigned        j1 = 0;
  unsigned        hi_test = hi_cross + 1;

  if (hi_test &gt; (n_city-1)) hi_test = 0;
</div></pre>
<p>
	Since the original order is needed to determine the correct
	positions for swaps we copy the individual tours:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">  tour1_new.resize(n_city);
  tour2_new.resize(n_city);
  
  for(unsigned i = 0; i &lt; n_city; i++)
        {
                tour1_new[i]    = tour1_old[i];
                tour2_new[i]    = tour2_old[i];
        }
</div></pre>

<p>
	Beginning from the starting index of the crossover we check
	at which position in the first tour the city occurs that is
	visited at the current index in the second tour. Thus we need
	to find the index of a city in a tour:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">unsigned find_city(unsigned city_name,unsigned n_city, 
                    std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour) {
        unsigned j1 = 0;
        while((j1 &lt; n_city) && (tour[j1]!=city_name)) {
           j1 = j1+1;
        }
        return j1;
}
</div></pre>
<p>
	Then we exchange the city at the current index with the city
	at this found index:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">void swap_city(unsigned city_pos1,unsigned city_pos2, 
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour) {
        unsigned          temp;
        temp            = tour[city_pos1];
        tour[city_pos1] = tour[city_pos2];
        tour[city_pos2] = temp;
}
</div></pre>
<p>
	Now we can perform the crossover by swapping
	city positions in both tours:
</p>
<pre><div class="code">if ( (lo_cross != hi_cross ) && (lo_cross != hi_test )) {
   j1      = lo_cross;
   while( j1 != hi_test) {
      swap_city(j1, find_city(tour1_old[j1], 
                 n_city, tour2_new), tour2_new);
      swap_city(j1, find_city(tour2_old[j1], 
                 n_city, tour1_new), tour1_new);
      j1=j1+1; if (j1&gt;(n_city-1)) j1 = 0;
   }
}
</div></pre>

<p>The whole function reads:</p>
<pre><div class="code">unsigned find_city(unsigned city_name,unsigned n_city, 
                    std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour) {
        unsigned j1 = 0;
        while((j1 &lt; n_city) && (tour[j1]!=city_name)) {
           j1 = j1+1;
        }
        return j1;
}



void swap_city(unsigned city_pos1,unsigned city_pos2, 
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour){
        unsigned          temp;
        temp            = tour[city_pos1];
        tour[city_pos1] = tour[city_pos2];
        tour[city_pos2] = temp;
}



void cross_tour(unsigned n_city, 
		unsigned lo_cross, unsigned hi_cross,
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour1_old, 
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour2_old,
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour1_new, 
                std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt;& tour2_new) {

   SIZE_CHECK( tour1_old.size() == tour2_old.size());

   unsigned        j1 = 0;
   unsigned        hi_test = hi_cross + 1;

   if (hi_test &gt; (n_city-1)) hi_test = 0;

      tour1_new.resize(n_city);
      tour2_new.resize(n_city);

      for(unsigned i = 0; i &lt; n_city; i++) {
         tour1_new[i]    = tour1_old[i];
         tour2_new[i]    = tour2_old[i];
      }

     if ( (lo_cross != hi_cross ) && (lo_cross != hi_test )) {
        j1      = lo_cross;
        while( j1 != hi_test) {
           swap_city(j1, find_city(tour1_old[j1], 
                      n_city, tour2_new), tour2_new);
           swap_city(j1, find_city(tour2_old[j1], 
                      n_city, tour1_new), tour1_new);
           j1=j1+1; if (j1 &gt; (n_city-1)) j1 = 0;
        }
     }
}
</div></pre>
