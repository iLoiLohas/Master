<h1>SunOS/Linux/MacOS</h1>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>
	To compile all LinAlg examples open a shell, change to the
	examples/LinAlg directory and type make:
</p>

<div class="shell">&gt; cd <b>[SharkRoot]</b>/examples/LinAlg
&gt; make
</div>

<p>
	Wait until the compilation is done. If you precompiled all examples
	during the installation it is possible that make just outputs a
	message like<br>
</p>

<div class="shell">make: Nothing to be done.
</div>

<p>
	The Makefile is automatically configured to provide the location
	of the header files and the Shark library. After the compilation
	the directory contains one object file and one executable per
	example program.
</p>

<h2>Execute the Program</h2>

<p>
	To run the executable just type its name in the current directory:
</p>

<div class="shell">&gt; ./g_inverse_matrix
input matrix:
1       2       -1
2       5       -1
1       2       0

generalized inverse matrix:
2       -2      3
-1      1       -1
-1      -8.88978e-17    1
</div>

<p>
	The program outputs a matrix and its inverse, which is computed
	with a call to Shark's LinAlg module. As you can see the computation
	is not 100% exact, as the computation of the inverse is a numerically
	challenging task (although the inaccuracy is very close to the
	numerical limits).
</p>

<p>
	That's it! You can use the example programs (including the Makefiles)
	as a starting point for own programs and experiments.
